GPP is a general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax,
suitable for a wide range of preprocessing tasks. Its independence
from any programming language makes it much more versatile than cpp,
while its syntax is lighter and more flexible than that of m4.

INSTALLATION
============

To compile GPP, you need the GNU C Compiler (GCC).  The following
instructions apply to most Unix systems.
 
  1. Compile with "make".  
     This creates the binary file "gpp", the man page "gpp.1", and the
     HTML manual "gpp.html".

  2. Install with "make install".  You may need superuser permissions.

     (Note: for non-system-wide installations, you can simply copy the
      binary and the documentation files to the directories of your
      choice.)

It is also possible to compile GPP on Windows using MS VC++.  In this
case, you need to ensure that the preprocessor macro WIN_NT is defined.
