(POTENTIAL) BUGS:

* many function names are not ANSI/ISO-compliant (e.g., str...)

* return values from malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), strdup() rarely checked

* poor/misleading typography in LaTeX version of manual

* spurious warning when comment on same line as #include directive

AESTHETIC/STYLISTIC ISSUES WITH SOURCE CODE:

* needs pretty-printing (more whitespace between arguments)

* needs function prototypes

* needs comments dividing code into sections

* static keyword seems to be used indiscriminately
