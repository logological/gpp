Welcome to GPP, a generic preprocessor.

GPP is Free Software. Please see the file COPYING for details.

The `doc' subdirectory contains a Unix man page and an HTML page
describing how to use GPP.  These files were generated by GPP from the
file gpp.pp, which can also be preprocessed to produce a LaTeX version
of the manual.  Only the man page is installed by default.

For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL
file.
