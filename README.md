# GPP

**[GPP](https://logological.org/gpp)** is a general-purpose
preprocessor with customizable syntax, suitable for a wide range of
preprocessing tasks. Its independence from any one programming
language makes it much more versatile than the C preprocessor (cpp),
while its syntax is lighter and more flexible than that of
[GNU m4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/). There are built-in macros
for use with C/C++, LaTeX, HTML, XHTML, and Prolog files.

GPP is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). It
is distributed under the terms of the [GNU Lesser General Public
Licence](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html).
