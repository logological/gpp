Version 2.20

    * GPP's arithmetic evaluation macro (#eval) now supports
      file-globbing via =~ (POSIX only)
    * there is now an #elif macro to simplify conditional branching
    * fixed a bug where GPP would be off by one when reporting line
      numbers in its error messages or with the #line meta-macro

Version 2.14

    * fixed a crash bug
    * added built-in macros `line' and 'file'
    * GPP documentation is now under a free licence

Version 2.13

    * fixed bug which caused GPP to crash when the same macro was
      defined twice on the command line
    * GPP should compile on more systems now; non-standard C functions
      have been replaced with custom code
    * INSTALL contains installation instructions for Windows, Unix,
      and other systems.
    * GPP now issues a warning on use of deprecated command-line
      options
    * GPP is now packaged in a manner similar to most GNU
      programs, including a `configure' configuration/installation
      script suitable for Unix-like systems
    * credits moved from manual to AUTHORS and THANKS files
    * CHANGELOG superseded by files ChangeLog (detailed, for
      developers) and NEWS (brief, user-visible changes only)
    * added list of bugs and wishes as BUGS and TODO
    * minor changes (mostly typographical) to the manual

Version 2.12

    * New command-line options:
      - -X for XHTML mode
      - --help displays command-line option summary
      - --version displays version information
      - "long options" -nostdinc, -nocurinc, etc. changed to --nostdinc,
        --nocurinc, etc.
    * fixed miscellaneous typographical, grammatical, and spelling
      mistakes in documentation
    * licence changed from GNU Library GPL 2 to GNU Lesser GPL 2.1
    * distribution now includes copy of the licence
    * new project maintainer: Tristan Miller
      <psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>


Version 2.1

    * Bugfixes:
      - bugfix in #defeval (can now be used to iteratively redefine a
        macro in terms of its previous definition)
      - bugfix in arithmetic evaluation (operator precedence between +
        and -, and between * and / was wrong)
    * Arithmetic evaluation:
      - length(...) builtin in #eval
      - all comparison operators revert to string comparison if
        arithmetic evaluation fails in #eval
    * Command-line options:
      - +n does the opposite of -n (do not preserve linefeeds; place
        *after* -C/-P)
      - -O sends output to file and stdout simultaneously
      - options to control directory search order for #include
      - option to adjust warning level
      - option to specify an include file marker to keep track of
        #include directives and line numbers in output
    * Misbehavior fixes:
      - numbered argument sequences (#1...#9) are disabled outside of
        definitions.
      - if a construct terminated by a newline is nested in last
        position within another construct, then the nested newline is
        optional. Concretely, this means that " #define myeval #eval #1 "
        is now valid.
      - macros defined on the command line with -D... can take named
        arguments.  The syntax is: -Dmacro(arg1,...)=definition ; the
        definition should conform to the rules of the mode specified on
        the command-line, although the arguments are specified in
        C-style syntax (but without spaces !)
      - input line numbers are almost always preserved when
        -includemarker is specified
    * Miscellaneous:
      - LaTeX version of the manual in addition to man and html formats.
