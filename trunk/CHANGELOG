CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1 (from 2.0):

Bugfixes:
- bugfix in #defeval (can now be used to iteratively redefine a macro in
  terms of its previous definition)
- bugfix in arithmetic evaluation (operator precedence between + and -, 
  and between * and / was wrong)

Arithmetic evaluation:
- length(...) builtin in #eval
- all comparison operators revert to string comparison if arithmetic
  evaluation fails in #eval

Command-line options:
- +n does the opposite of -n (do not preserve linefeeds; place *after* -C/-P)
- -O sends output to file and stdout simultaneously
- options to control directory search order for #include
- option to adjust warning level
- option to specify an include file marker to keep track of #include 
  directives and line numbers in output

Misbehavior fixes:
- numbered argument sequences (#1...#9) are disabled outside of definitions.
- if a construct terminated by a newline is nested in last position within
  another construct, then the nested newline is optional. Concretely,
  this means that " #define myeval #eval #1 " is now valid.
- macros defined on the command line with -D... can take named arguments.
  The syntax is: -Dmacro(arg1,...)=definition ; the definition should
  conform to the rules of the mode specified on the command-line, although
  the arguments are specified in C-style syntax (but without spaces !)
- input line numbers are almost always preserved when -includemarker
  is specified

Miscellaneous:
- LaTeX version of the manual in addition to man and html formats.
